// Write a function called ABCheck that takes in a string parameter and returns true if the characters a and b are separated by exactly 3 places anywhere in the string at least once (ie. "lane borrowed" would result in true because there is exactly three characters between a and b).

// Otherwise return false.

// For a greater challenge, try to solve this problem using an array method like .forEach or .map

function ABCheck(str){
  
}

ABCheck("lane borrowed") //true
ABCheck("play basketball") //false
