Here we will be creating a calculator. 

Write a function called calculatorCreator. 

Create a variable called num inside of calculatorCreator that is equal to the value 0.

Use the module pattern to create four additional methods named add, subtract, divide and multiply. These methods should each take in a number parameter. They should use the parameter to change the original num variable (by adding, subtracting, dividing and multiplying).
