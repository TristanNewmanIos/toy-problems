function count(num) {
  // code here
}

var newClosure = count(5);

Here we have a function named count that takes in a number.
Create a closure that will increment num by one and return the result.

(Hint: When newClosure is invoked, you should see the number 6 in the terminal below. If it is invoked again, you should see the number 7, etc... )
